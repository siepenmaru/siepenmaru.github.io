## Hey there.

I'm Avatar (yes, like the airbender... or the blue people).

So, every leet employable 10x programmer has their own website, right? I figured I may as well set up this little space for myself in this corner of the internet. I have to say though, I'm starting to get the appeal of this (web 1.0 is cool, [present tense](https://neocities.org/browse)).

This site is a work in progress! I may come back to this and add some more pages talking about whatever I feel like.

## Some things I'm into

- Messing around with all sorts of things on my **Linux** (‚òùÔ∏èü§ì) machine! More on that [here](misc/software).
- Occasionally, I carry my Fuji X100T with me to **snap a few pictures** of the world around me. I quite like the way film photographs look, and I think the camera does a good enough job of getting there without the need to edit the RAWs.
- Recently, I've been having a lot of fun jumping through webrings, surfing the information superhighway like it's 2001; something I didn't do much of at the time, seeing as how I was in diapers.
- I might make a list of media I enjoy some time later. It's always difficult when someone asks me "what's your favourite song/movie/anime?". Seriously, how do people do it? I'll direct them to that list instead.

## What now?

Like so many other compsci freshgrads, I'm on the hunt for a job! If, for some reason, I look like I'm right for your team, shoot me an email or message!

Other than that, I've been playing around with whatever sparks my interest at the moment. I'm currently working on a cross-platform GUI planner app called Zeitseer. It's still in its very early stages, but you can check out its status on github, as I've licensed it under the GPL. Open-source software fascinates me, and I'd love to contribute more to the community in the future.

## Online Presence
You can find me, along with some of my past projects on [github](https://github.com/siepenmaru). For privacy reasons, that's all I'm willing to put down here for now. If you've found this site somehow, you probably already know where to reach me!
