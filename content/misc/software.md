## How did I get here?

I think the first time I was exposed to Linux was seeing someone use Ubuntu with the Unity desktop environment. I remember thinking its interface was the coolest thing. I thought it looked like a video game console but, well, on a computer.

I first started using it myself on my old chromebook. I fiddled around with it and got some distribution running xfce using [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton). It was fun for a while but it wasn't terribly practical, since you'd have to access the desktop environment via the ChromeOS browser and couldn't directly dual-boot it.

I started to *really* get the bug when I pieced together a PC out of old hand-me-downs. For whatever reason, I couldn't be bothered to get a Windows 10 image, and installed Ubuntu instead. This marked the start of an entire distro-hopping journey for me (as one does). I've tried running Ubuntu, Debian unstable, Pop!OS (didn't last long), and Manjaro; nothing too weird. I've been daily driving a distribution called **EndeavourOS** coupled with **KDE** for a little over 2 years now and I find it quite comfy.

## Current Fascinations

My mind's been rather scattered recently. There's just been so many things that pique my interest. I started exploring the Godot game engine as a platform for creating [Zeitseer](/#independent-projects), since I wanted to be able to package the app for multiple platforms (something I had trouble with while working on [Yomi-mate](/#independent-projects)). This, naturally, exposed me to the gamedev side of Godot, which reignited my interest in that field again. Through this, I also *finally* came to understand what shaders are? and made me want to create some of my own??

And *then* I found out about Tauri, which, similar to Electron, lets you build the frontend of your GUI app using your usual JS frameworks like React and Vue.js. I'd had previous experience with Vue before, so I jumped ship and started working on the project with Tauri instead. But now, seeing as how Tauri is built using Rust, that made me want to make something with Rust.

That's just a few of the things circling the top of my head these days.
